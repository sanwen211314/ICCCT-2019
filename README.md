# Title
Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction Algorithm Using Spearman’s Rank Correlation

# Abstract
Hyperspectral Unmixing (HU), the method of estimating a pure set of spectral signatures and their corresponding merged percentages at all pixels in the image, is a significant task for hyperspectral analysis, visualization, and understanding. Endmember Extraction, the method of extracting a pure set of signatures from an image, is very challenging due to intrinsic complexity in the hyperspectral data. Many attempts have been made in the last decade to extract endmembers using either convexity or orthogonal-projection based approach. A novel endmember extraction algorithm is proposed in this paper which explores convexity-based approach using Spearman’s Rank Correlation (SRC). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real dataset. The simulation results on synthetic and real dataset show that the proposed algorithm is reducing Spectral Angle Error (SAE) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID). Endmembers extracted by the proposed algorithm is having a high correlation with Ground-Truth (GT) endmembers.
